# I. The Atheist Heritage

Sartre begins by examining the historical context of Mallarmé in order to identify the problems to which Mallarmé and other authors responded. Sartre argues that 18th-19th century French authors faced a meaning crisis with the death of God and scientific rationalism. Their response was largely resentment and a turn to nihilism.

It's striking that Sartre describes their views very similar to his own views in *Being and Nothingness*. I suspect that is part of Sartre's preoccupation with 19th-century French authors. As we shall see, Mallarmé's doesn't (fully) succumb to nihilism.

More immediately, Sartre argues here that their nihilism still presupposed an unconscious belief in God. They presuppose God because, I think, they despise and condemn man, which implies an objective standard to which men fail to conform.

# II. The Chosen One

This part sketches *how* different authors responded to the above problem.

With the death of God, poetry can no longer strive for transcendence or rely on (divine) inspiration. So, the poets retreated to formalism of language.

(I'm reminded here of how post-Kantianism gives way to Wittgenstein: since we cannot attain synthetic *a priori* truth, there is a tendency to devolve to identifying formal structures, -- whether of reason or of language -- which are disappointingly contentless. The only avenue for transcendence often seems to be mysticism, e.g., the end of Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*.)

But Mallarmé's genius is to recognize that it is inherent in the kind of tragic beings we are for us to also relate to the world: not in achieving transcendent truth but in thought's negativity. For example, formal structures arise from abstraction, which requires the mind to negate the particular, to separate off the common features of things.

Sartre compares this to Hegel's discussion of how stoicism -- which aims for the abstract, contentless universal -- gives way to skepticism -- which embraces negativity but no other-worldliness.

The question remains: How does Mallarmé do this?

# III. Requiem for a Poet: Mallarmé (1842-1898) 

Mallarmé was tempted to suicide. It's a form of transcendence because it goes against our material nature, by extinguishing it. But it is unlike traditional transcendence, which strives for something affirmative in attaining positive Being. Obviously, suicide would be negative, aiming at non-Being.

But a crucial insight is that it isn't simply that one transcends toward non-being. Rather, with suicide, one's absence haunts the world, affecting others left behind. Hence, suicide would not be a contentless negation of Hegelian stoicism.

Mallarmé, though, goes further by not committing literal suicide. He decides to perform "poetic suicide", thereby achieving the above while still living. Thus, he affirms the tragedy of life while not succumbing to the naive or romantic nihilism of the literal suicide.

Poetic suicide consists in creating poems in which the poet's existence is negated. That is, the words would seem to have a meaning and necessity all on their own, independent of any author's intent, as well as independent of any divine inspiration. Thereby, Mallarmé achieves a first kind of silence: that of the author. Sartre thus calls Mallarmé a "wizard", since he imbues the words with "magic". "Magic" is Sartre's technical term that refers to phenomena that appear to combine the inertness of material things with the spontaneity of minds (think of the brooms of *Fantasia*).

But there is a second silence. In Mallarmé's poetry, the meaning of individual words is negated. Instead of each word being treated as having meaning on its own, they are treated as things. Nevertheless, each word's relationship to other words in his poems gives them altogether a spiritual meaning. By stripping them of meaning, the corresponding things referred to by those words become negated or absent. Thus, those things referred to through this absence constitute the second silence. This has the effect of making the world itself absent, since all the things of the world are not directly referred to in the poem.

Like Roquentin at the end of *Nausea*, Mallarmé strives to overcome absurdity/nausea through art, namely by creating poems whose words magically possess a spiritual meaning through their necessary relations with one another. But beyond Roquentin, Mallarmé recognizes the tragic futility of this. His poetic suicide shows poetry's impossibility. The death of God had previously shown that poetry cannot transcend the world to a necessary being that would give meaning to our existence. Mallarmé shows that poetry is impossible because its attempt at transcendence can at most lead to negating the world and the self.

Thus, the theme of his poetry is ultimately "the impossibility of being man" (142). This is because human-reality consists in an attempt to transcend our finitude to become complete selves, Being-in-itself-for-itself. But human-reality, like poetry, is doomed to failure:

> Man is that being prodded at the point of a sword to ascend to God’s throne without ever reaching it (123)

But Sartre says that "this quiet tragedy is only the next to last meaning of the poem; ultimately, everything must be annihilated" (142). That is, "the truth these poems have come to embody is Nothingness" (142).

The idea here seems to be that human-reality comes into existence through the world itself. This indicates a deeper absurdity than the fact that what happens in the world is absolutely contingent, i.e., at bottom without sufficient reason. The deeper absurdity is that such a world gave rise to a being that would futilely be driven to overcome this absurd state of affairs.

Hence, Mallarmé's negation of both the world and the self expresses the truth of Nothingness: there is nothing more absurd than the fact that man exists. And that truth is expressed -- absurdly -- by Mallarmé's creation of poetry whose spiritual meaning constitutes a "necessity abolishing chance in the suicide of the Poem and Poetry" (144).

What's more, Mallarmé died just before he was in a position to compose a true magnum opus. His life is thus the "very embodiment of man's tragedy" (144).
