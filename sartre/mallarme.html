<h1 class="title">Man, the fanatic</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Summary of Sartre’s <em>Mallarmé, or the Poet of
Nothingness</em></p>
<p class="author">Curtis Sommerlatte</p>
</header>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is man, that ‘fanatic,’ if not a total and endlessly
self-negating impotence who, in spite of himself, still manages to
affirm himself?” (124)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="i.-the-atheist-heritage">I. The Atheist Heritage</h1>
<p>Sartre begins by examining the historical context of Mallarmé in
order to identify the problems to which Mallarmé and other authors
responded. Sartre argues that 18th-19th century French authors faced a
meaning crisis with the death of God and scientific rationalism. Their
response was largely resentment and a turn to nihilism.</p>
<p>It’s striking that Sartre describes their views very similar to his
own views in <em>Being and Nothingness</em>. I suspect that is part of
Sartre’s preoccupation with 19th-century French authors. As we shall
see, Mallarmé’s doesn’t (fully) succumb to nihilism.</p>
<p>More immediately, Sartre argues here that their nihilism still
presupposed an unconscious belief in God. They presuppose God because, I
think, they despise and condemn man, which implies an objective standard
to which men fail to conform.</p>
<h1 id="ii.-the-chosen-one">II. The Chosen One</h1>
<p>This part sketches <em>how</em> different authors responded to the
above problem.</p>
<p>With the death of God, poetry can no longer strive for transcendence
or rely on (divine) inspiration. So, the poets retreated to formalism of
language.</p>
<p>(I’m reminded here of how post-Kantianism gives way to Wittgenstein:
since we cannot attain synthetic <em>a priori</em> truth, there is a
tendency to devolve to identifying formal structures, – whether of
reason or of language – which are disappointingly contentless. The only
avenue for transcendence often seems to be mysticism, e.g., the end of
Wittgenstein’s <em>Tractatus</em>.)</p>
<p>But Mallarmé’s genius is to recognize that it is inherent in the kind
of tragic beings we are for us to also relate to the world: not in
achieving transcendent truth but in thought’s negativity. For example,
formal structures arise from abstraction, which requires the mind to
negate the particular, to separate off the common features of things.
(One might compare this to Kierkegaard’s lauding of Socrates as the
world-historical figure who brought irony into the world and made it the
core of subjectivity.)</p>
<p>Sartre compares this to Hegel’s discussion of how stoicism – which
aims for the abstract, contentless universal – gives way to skepticism –
which embraces negativity but no other-worldliness. But, somehow,
Mallarmé goes beyond skepticism. So, how does Mallarmé do this?</p>
<h1 id="iii.-requiem-for-a-poet-mallarmé-1842-1898">III. Requiem for a
Poet: Mallarmé (1842-1898)</h1>
<p>Mallarmé was tempted to suicide. It’s a form of transcendence because
it goes against our material nature, by extinguishing it. But it is
unlike traditional transcendence, which strives for something
affirmative in attaining positive Being. Obviously, suicide would be
negative, aiming at non-Being.</p>
<p>But a crucial insight is that it isn’t simply that one transcends
toward non-being. Rather, with suicide, one’s absence haunts the world,
affecting others left behind. Hence, suicide would not be a contentless
negation of Hegelian stoicism.</p>
<p>Mallarmé, though, goes further by not committing literal suicide. He
decides to perform “poetic suicide”, thereby achieving the above while
still living. Thus, he affirms the tragedy of life while not succumbing
to the naive or romantic nihilism of the literal suicide.</p>
<p>Poetic suicide consists in creating poems in which the poet’s
existence is negated. That is, the words would seem to have a meaning
and necessity all on their own, independent of any author’s intent, as
well as independent of any divine inspiration. Thereby, Mallarmé
achieves a first kind of silence: that of the author. Sartre thus calls
Mallarmé a “wizard”, since he imbues the words with “magic”. “Magic” is
Sartre’s technical term that refers to phenomena that appear to combine
the inertness of material things with the spontaneity of minds (think of
the brooms of <em>Fantasia</em>).</p>
<p>But there is a second silence. In Mallarmé’s poetry, the meaning of
individual words is negated. Instead of each word being treated as
having meaning on its own, they are treated as things. Nevertheless,
each word’s relationship to other words in his poems gives them
altogether a spiritual meaning. By stripping them of meaning, the
corresponding things referred to by those words become negated or
absent. Thus, those things referred to through this absence constitute
the second silence. This has the effect of making the world itself
absent, since all the things of the world are not directly referred to
in the poem.</p>
<p>Like Roquentin at the end of <em>Nausea</em>, Mallarmé strives to
overcome absurdity/nausea through art, namely by creating poems whose
words magically possess a spiritual meaning through their necessary
relations with one another. But going beyond Roquentin, Mallarmé
recognizes the tragic futility of this. His poetic suicide shows
poetry’s impossibility. The death of God had previously shown that
poetry cannot transcend the world to a necessary being that would give
meaning to our existence. Mallarmé shows that poetry is impossible
because its attempt at transcendence can at most lead to negating the
world and the self.</p>
<p>Thus, the theme of his poetry is ultimately “the impossibility of
being man” (142). This is because human-reality consists in an attempt
to transcend our finitude to become complete selves,
Being-in-itself-for-itself. But human-reality, like poetry, is doomed to
failure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is that being prodded at the point of a sword to ascend to God’s
throne without ever reaching it (123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Sartre says that “this quiet tragedy is only the next to last
meaning of the poem; ultimately, everything must be annihilated” (142).
That is, “the truth these poems have come to embody is Nothingness”
(142).</p>
<p>The idea here seems to be that human-reality comes into existence
through the world itself. This indicates a deeper absurdity than the
fact that what happens in the world is absolutely contingent, i.e., at
bottom without sufficient reason. The deeper absurdity is that such a
world gave rise to a being that would futilely be driven to overcome
this absurd state of affairs.</p>
<p>Hence, Mallarmé’s negation of both the world and the self expresses
the truth of Nothingness: there is nothing more absurd than the fact
that man exists. And that truth is expressed – absurdly – by Mallarmé’s
creation of poetry whose spiritual meaning constitutes a “necessity
abolishing chance in the suicide of the Poem and Poetry” (144).</p>
<p>What’s more, Mallarmé died just before he was in a position to
compose a true magnum opus. His life is thus the “very embodiment of
man’s tragedy” (144).</p>
