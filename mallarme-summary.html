<h1 class="title">Summary of Sartre’s <em>Mallarmé, or the Poet of
Nothingness</em></h1>
<p class="author">Curtis Sommerlatte</p>
</header>
<h1 id="summary-of-sartres-mallarmé-or-the-poet-of-nothingness">Summary
of Sartre’s <em>Mallarmé, or the Poet of Nothingness</em></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is man, that ‘fanatic,’ if not a total and endlessly
self-negating impotence who, in spite of himself, still manages to
affirm himself?” (124)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="i.-the-atheist-heritage">I. The Atheist Heritage</h2>
<p>This section is about the historical context of Mallarmé, the problem
that authors &amp; poets responded to.</p>
<p>Sartre argues that 18th-19th century French poets responded to the
death of God and scientific rationalism with resentment and turning to
nihilism, but this nihilism still presupposed an unconscious belief in
God.</p>
<p>It’s striking that he describes their views very similar to his own
views in <em>Being and Nothingness</em>. So, one question is how Sartre
avoids their nihilism. I suspect that is part of Sartre’s preoccupation
with 19th-century French authors.</p>
<p>They presuppose God because, I think, they despise and condemn man,
which implies an objective standard to which men fail to conform.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-the-chosen-one">II. The Chosen One</h2>
<p>This part sketches <em>how</em> different authors responded to the
above problem.</p>
<p>With the death of God, poetry can no longer strive for transcendence
or rely on (divine) inspiration. So, the poets retreated to formalism of
language.</p>
<p>I’m reminded here of how post-Kantianism gives way to Wittgenstein:
since we cannot attain synthetic a priori truth, there is a tendency to
devolve to identifying formal structures (whether of reason or of
language), which are disappointingly contentless. The only avenue for
transcendence is mysticism (e.g., Wittgenstein’s
<em>Tractatus</em>).</p>
<p>But Mallarmé’s genius is to recognize that it is inherent in the kind
of tragic beings we are for us to also relate to the world: not in
achieving transcendent truth but in thought’s negativity (e.g., formal
structures arise from abstraction, which requires the mind to negate the
particular, to separate off the common features of things).</p>
<p>Sartre compares this to Hegel’s discussion of how stoicism – which
aims for the abstract, contentless universal – gives way to skepticism –
which embraces negativity but no other-worldliness.</p>
<p>The question remains: How does Mallarmé do this?</p>
<h2 id="iii.-requiem-for-a-poet-mallarmé-1842-1898">III. Requiem for a
Poet: Mallarmé (1842-1898)</h2>
<p>This section answers the above question, but it’s difficult.</p>
<p>Mallarmé was tempted to suicide. Suicide is a form of transcendence.
That’s because suicide goes against our material nature, by
extinguishing it.</p>
<p>But it is unlike traditional transcendence, which would be
affirmative, in which one attains positive Being. Obviously, suicide
would be negative, aiming at non-Being.</p>
<p>But a crucial insight is that it isn’t simply that one transcends
toward non-being. Rather, with suicide, one’s absence haunts the world,
affecting others left behind. (Hence, this is why suicide would not be a
contentless negation of Hegelian stoicism.)</p>
<p>Mallarmé, though, goes further by not committing literal suicide. He
decides to perform “poetic suicide”, thereby achieving the above while
still living. Thus, it is a way of affirming life and not succumbing to
‘naive nihilism’ or the ‘romantic nihilism’ of the suicide (those are my
terms).</p>
<p>More fully, this poetic suicide is the first of two types of silence
that Mallarmé’s poetry uses.</p>
<p>Poetic suicide is to create poems in which the poet’s existence is
negated. That is, the words would seem to have a meaning and necessity
all on their own, independent of any author’s intent, as well as
independent of any divine inspiration. Thereby, the author is silent.
Sartre thus calls Mallarmé a “wizard”, since he imbues the words with
“magic”. That’s his technical term referring to phenomena that appear to
combine the inertness of material things with the spontaneity of minds
(think of the brooms of <em>Fantasia</em>).</p>
<p>But there is a second silence. In Mallarmé’s poetry, the meaning of
individual words is negated. Instead of each word being treated as
having a meaning on its own, they are treated as things. Nevertheless,
each word’s relationship to other words in his poems gives them
altogether a spiritual meaning. By stripping them of meaning, the
corresponding things referred to by those words become negated or
absent. Thus, those things referred to through this absence constitute
the second silence. This has the effect of making the world itself
absent, since all the things of the world are not directly referred to
in the poem.</p>
<p>Like Roquentin at the end of <em>Nausea</em>, Mallarmé strives to
overcome absurdity/nausea through art, namely by creating poems whose
words magically possess a spiritual meaning through their necessary
relations with one another.</p>
<p>Mallarmé’s poetic suicide shows poetry’s impossibility. The death of
God had previously shown that poetry cannot transcend the world to a
necessary being that would give meaning to our existence. Mallarmé shows
that poetry is impossible because its attempt at transcendence can at
most lead to negating the world and the self.</p>
<p>Thus, the theme of his poetry is ultimately “the impossibility of
being man” (142). This is because human-reality consists in an attempt
to transcend our finitude to become complete selves,
Being-in-itself-for-itself. But human-reality, like poetry, is doomed to
failure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is that being prodded at the point of a sword to ascend to God’s
throne without ever reaching it (123)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Sartre says that “this quiet tragedy is only the next to last
meaning of the poem; ultimately, everything must be annihilated” (142).
That is, “the truth these poems have come to embody is Nothingness”
(142).</p>
<p>The idea here seems to be that human-reality comes into existence
through the world itself. This indicates a deeper absurdity than the
fact that what happens in the world is absolutely contingent, i.e., at
bottom without sufficient reason. The deeper absurdity is that such a
world gave rise to a being that would futilely be driven to overcome
this absurd state of affairs. Hence, Mallarmé’s negation of the world
and self expresses the truth of Nothingness: there is nothing more
absurd than the fact that man exists. (I might be going beyond the text
here some.) And that is truth is expressed – absurdly – by Mallarmé’s
creation of poetry whose spiritual meaning constitutes a “necessity
abolishing chance in the suicide of the Poem and Poetry” (144).</p>
<p>What’s more, Mallarmé died just before he was in a position to
compose a true magnum opus. His life is thus the “very embodiment of
man’s tragedy” (144).</p>
